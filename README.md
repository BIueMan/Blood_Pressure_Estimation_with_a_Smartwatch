# Blood Pressure Estimation Using a Smartphone Camera
This is a resoursh project on Blood Pressure Estimation Using a Smartphone Camera under the SIPL lab. It includes useg of tool like Singal prosesing, Image prossing on the Transform to a spectrogram. deep learning and useing a medical dataset (MIMIC) and build are own dataset useing a smartphone, inorder to achive that.
Although we were not able to achieve amazing results. Mainly because part of the project was on gathering diverse dataset, during the corona time, Which limited the ability to produce one. It still seems like the model was managed to learn in the right direction, and we hope that with bigger and diverse dataset, it will be possible to build a system that will give better results.
